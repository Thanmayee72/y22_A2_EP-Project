Resume Builder: Developed a dynamic Resume Builder application that allows users to create, personalize, and download professional resumes. The application features an intuitive interface, various 
templates, and a real-time preview of the resume. Implemented key functionalities like data input forms, section management, and PDF export. The tool is completely free of cost, ensuring accessibility
for everyone. Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for the frontend, Node.js with Express as middleware, and styling with Material UI and React-Bootstrap. This project demonstrates
my skills in front-end development, user experience design, and practical application deployment.
